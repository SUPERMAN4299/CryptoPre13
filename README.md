## 🛠 Installation

### 1️⃣ Clone / Download

```
git clone https://github.com/yourrepo/tradeai
cd tradeai
```

### 2️⃣ Create Virtual Environment

```
python -m venv venv
venv/Scripts/activate     # Windows
```

### 3️⃣ Install Dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## ▶️ Running the Streamlit App

```
streamlit run ui/app.py
```

Now open the browser window.
Enter a crypto symbol like:

* BTCUSDT
* ETHUSD
* SOLUSDT

The system will show:

* Candlesticks
* Volume bars
* Buy/Sell points
* Predicted movement
* Confidence score

## 🔧 How the Prediction Engine Works

### 🔹 Pipeline

```
Symbol → Data Fetch → Feature Processor → Scaler → LSTM Model → Signal → UI
```

### 🔹 ML Model

* LSTM neural network
* Sequence windowing
* OHLCV + engineered features
* Universal scaling

### 🔹 Output

* Next-step trend prediction
* Signal → Buy / Sell / Hold
* Confidence score

## 🧪 Retraining Models

Full guide in `/docs/retraining.md`

Example command:

```
python train.py --symbol BTCUSDT --epochs 50
```

New model + scaler will be saved automatically.

## 🖥 Build Desktop EXE (Optional)

To package as a Windows EXE:

```
pyinstaller --onefile --add-data "models;models" --add-data "scalers;scalers" ui/app.py
```

You can sell the EXE separately or provide it to buyers.
